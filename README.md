==================================================================================================================================

I've been coding since I was 12 years old and found an Atari 400 with B.A.S.I.C. at a garage sale. My passion with code revolves around creating exciting, new experiences that solve real problems. These days my focus is on UX engineering, including React, Vue.js and Svelte. I'm also experienced with backend development, including PHP (Laravel), C# and Rust. Beyond engineering, I've worked as a Senior Product Designer. I combine my design and user research skills with engineering to create and launch products in my free time.
